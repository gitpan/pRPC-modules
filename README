NAME
    RPC::pServer, RPC::pClient - Perl extensions for writing
    pRPC servers and clients

DESCRIPTION
    pRPC-modules (Perl RPC) is a package that simplifies the writing of
    Perl based client/server applications. RPC::pServer is the package
    used on the server side, and you guess what RPC::pClient is for.
    See the RPC::pServer(3) and RPC::pClient(3) manpages for detailed
    information.

    pRPC works by defining a set of of functions that may be executed by the
    client. For example, the server might offer a function "multiply" to the
    client. Now a function call

        @result = $con->Call('multiply', $a, $b);

    on the client will be mapped to a corresponding call

        multiply($con, $data, $a, $b);

    on the server. The function call's result will be returned to the
    client and stored in the array @result. Simple, eh? :-)
